# <center> Chapter 6.1 The Memory Hierarchy

## Storage technologies and trends

### Random-Access Memory(RAM)
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">

* **Key features**
  * <font color='red'>RAM </font>is traditionally packaged as a chip
  * Basic storage unit is normally a <font color = 'red'>cell</font>
  * Multiple RAM chips form a memory

* **RAM comes in two varieties:**
  * SRAM(Static RAM)
  * DRAM(Dynamic RAM)

**SRAM vs DRAM Summary**

||Trans.<br/>per bit|Acess<br/>time|Needs refresh?|Needs EDC?|Cost|Applications|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|SRAM|4 or 6|1$\times$|No|Maybe|100 $\times$ |Cache memories|
|DRAM|1|10$\times$|Yes|Yes|1$\times$|Main memories frame buffers

</font>

### Nonvolatile Memories
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">

* **DRAM and SRAM are volatile memories**
  * Lose information if powered off
* **Nonvolatile memories retain value even if powered off**
  * ROM -> PROM -> EPROM -> EEPROM -> flash memory
</font>

### Disk 
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">

#### Geometry
* Disks consist of **platters**, each with two **surfaces**.
* Each surface consists of concentric rings called **tracks**.
* Each track consists of **sectors** seperated by **gaps**.
* Aligned tracks form a **cylinder**.

#### Capacity
* **Capacity**:Maximum number of bits that can be stored.
  * usually expressed in gigabytes(1 GB = $10^9$Bytes)
* Capacity is determined by these factors:
  * **Recording density**(bits/in): The number of bits that can be squeezed into 1-inch segment of a track.
  * **Track density**(tracks/in): The number of tracks that can be squeezed into a 1-inch segment of the radius extending from the center of the platter.
  * **Areal density**(bits/in): The product of the recording density and the track density.

* Modern high-capacity disks use a technique known as ***multiple zone recording***, where the set of cylinders is partitioned into disjoint subsets known as ***recording zones***.
 
 #### Operation

![](./Pictures/6/Disk%20Operation.png)
* **Acess time**
  * ***Seek time***:Toread the contents of some target sector, the arm first positions the head over the track that contains the target sector.
  * ***Rotational latency***:Once the head is in the position over the track, the drive waits for the first bit of the target sector to pass under the head.
  * ***Transfer time***

## Locality of reference
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">
<b>

* <font color ='red'>Principle of Locality</font>:Programs tend to use data and instructions with addresses near or equal to those they have used recently</b>
<br/>

* **Temporal locality**:
  * Recently referenced items are likely to be referenced again in the near future

* **Spatial locality**:
   * Items with nearby addresses tend to be referenced close together in time
</font>

## Memory Hierarchy
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">

* <b>Some fundamental and enduring properties of hardware and software:</b>
  * Fast storage technologies cost more per byte, have less capacity, and require more power(heat!).
  * The gap between CPU and main memory speed is widening.
  * Well-written programs tend to exhibit good locality.
<br/>
* <b>These Fundamental properties complement each other beautifully.
* They suggest an approach for organizing memory and storage system know as a <font color ='red'>memory hierarchy</font>.

### Caches
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">
<font color='red'>
<b>

* *Cache*:</font>A smaller, faster storage device that acts as a staging area for a subset of the data in a larger, slower device.
<br/>

* Fundamental idea of  a memory hierarchy:
  * </b>For each k, the faster, smaller device at level k serves as s cache for the larger, slower device at level k+1.
* <b>Why do memory hierarchy work?
  * </b>Because of locality, programs tend to access the data at level k more often than they access the data at level k+1.
  * Thus, the storage at level k+1 can be slower, and thus larger and cheaper per bit.

<bs/>

* <font color ='red'><b>Big idea:</font>The memory hierarchy creates a large pool of memory that costs as much as  the cheap storage near the bottom, but that serves data to programs at the rate of the first storage near the top. 

</font></b>

#### Hits
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">

The particular data object *d* which are stored in level *k+1* happen to be cached at level *k*.
</font>

#### Misses

* Cold miss
* Conflict miss 
* Capacity miss

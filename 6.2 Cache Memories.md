## Issues with Writes
<font size =4.5 face="Consolas">

**write hit**:
* write-through: immediately write *w*'s cache block to the next level.
* write-back: write the updated block to the next lower level only when it is evicted from the cache by the replacement algorithm.

**write miss**:
* write-allocate: loads the corresponding block from the next lower level into the cache and then update the cache block.
* no-write-allocate: bypass the cache and writes the word directly to the next lower level.
